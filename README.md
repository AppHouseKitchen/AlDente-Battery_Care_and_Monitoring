# AlDente üçù
_MacOS menu bar tool to limit maximum charging percentage_

#### Don't overcook your battery! Keep it fresh and chewy with AlDente.

## Why do I need this?
Li-Ion batteries (like the one in your MacBook) last the longest when operating between 20 and 80 percent. Keeping your battery at 100% at all times can shorten the lifespan of your MacBook significantly.

## Download:
You can download the app from GitHub: <https://github.com/davidwernhart/AlDente/releases>

## Installation Guide
An installation guide can be found on our website: https://apphousekitchen.com/installation-guide/

## How to use:
When the installation is finished, enter your desired max. charging percentage by clicking on the üçù icon on your menu bar. Usually, the operating system will take a minute or two registering the changes, so be patient. You can check if it's working by setting the max. percentage to e.g.: 80%. After a while, clicking on your battery icon will report "Battery is not charging" if you have more than ‚âà73% left, even though your charger is connected. Notice that in this state, your MacBook is still powered by the charger, but the battery is not charging anymore.

For some reason, macOS will always try to squeeze in a few more percent than specified. For example, if you set yours to 80% it will stop charging at around 83%, so be patient.

IMPORTANT: Keeping your battery at a lower percentage, such as 20-80%, over weeks without doing full cycles (100%-0%) can result in a disturbed battery calibration. When this happens, your Macbook might turn off with 40-50% left or your battery capacity will drop significantly. However, this is only due to a disturbed battery calibration and not because of a faulty or degraded battery. To avoid this issue, we recommend doing at least one full cycle (0%-100%) every two weeks. Even if your battery calibration gets disturbed, doing 4+ full cycles will recalibrate your battery and the capacity will go up again.

<details>
  <summary>HELP MY BATTERY CAPACITY DROPPED AND MY MACBOOK TURNS OFF WITH 50% LEFT</summary>
  Keeping your battery at a lower percentage, such as 20-70%, over weeks without doing full cycles (0%-100%-0%) can result in a disturbed battery calibration. When this happens, your Macbook might turn off with 40-50% left or your battery capacity will drop significantly. However, this is only due to a disturbed battery calibration and not because of a faulty or degraded battery. To avoid this issue, we recommend doing at least one full cycle (0%-100%) every month. Even if your battery calibration gets disturbed, doing 4-5 full cycles will recalibrate your battery and the capacity will go up again.

  <summary>WHAT IS ALDENTE CLASSIC?</summary>
  AlDente Classic is our original version of AlDente. First introduced in 2020 and further developed until March 2021. With a complete rewrite of the code of AlDente and the introduction of AlDente Pro, we decided to rename the original AlDente in AlDente Classic and use the name AlDente (Free) or AlDente Pro with synchronous versioning between these two from now on.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>WHY IS ALDENTE NOT SUPPORTED BY OLDER VERSIONS OF MACOS AND ARE YOU PLANNING TO SUPPORT OLDER MACOS VERSIONS IN THE FUTURE?</summary>
  Due to SwiftUI not being compatible with older versions of macOS, AlDente is only compatible with macOS 11 Big Sur on newer. Even though it might be possible to get AlDente to work on older MacBooks and macOS versions too, we are currently not working on it.
</details>

<details>
