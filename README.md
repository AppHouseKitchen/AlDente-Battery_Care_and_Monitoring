# AlDente - Charge Limiterüçù
_MacOS menu bar tool to limit maximum charging percentage_

#### Don't overcook your battery! Keep it fresh and chewy with AlDente.

## Why do I need this?
Li-Ion batteries (like the one in your MacBook) last the longest when operating between 20 and 80 percent. Keeping your battery at 100% at all times can shorten the lifespan of your MacBook significantly.

## Features of AlDente Free

You can either set it by using the slide bar or by typing in the desired percentage in the field above and pressing enter afterwards.

* Discharge - This feature allows your MacBook to run completely on Battery even if it is plugged in. Therefore, you can actively discharge your MacBook to a more healthy percentage. Unfortunately, while Discharge is activated, clamshell mode is not supported due to technical limitations.

## Installation Guide
An installation guide can be found on our website: https://apphousekitchen.com/installation-guide/

## How to use
When the installation is finished, enter your desired max. charging percentage by clicking on the üçù icon on your menu bar. Usually, the operating system will take a minute or two registering the changes, so be patient. You can check if it's working by setting the max. percentage to e.g.: 80%. After a while, clicking on your battery icon will report "Battery is not charging" if you have more than ‚âà73% left, even though your charger is connected. Notice that in this state, your MacBook is still powered by the charger, but the battery is not charging anymore.

IMPORTANT: Keeping your battery at a lower percentage, such as under 80%, over weeks without doing full cycles (100%-0%) can result in a disturbed battery calibration. When this happens, your Macbook might turn off with 40-50% left or your battery capacity will drop significantly. However, this is only due to a disturbed battery calibration and not because of a faulty or degraded battery. To avoid this issue, we recommend doing at least one full cycle (0%-100%) every two weeks. Even if your battery calibration gets disturbed, doing 4+ full cycles will recalibrate your battery and the capacity will go up again.

## Disclaimer:
I do not take any responsibility for any sort of damage in result of using this tool! Although this had no negative side effects for me and thousands of others, AlDente still taps in some very low level system functions that are not meant to be tampered with. Use it at your own risk!
